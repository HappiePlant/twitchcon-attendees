# TwitchCon Attendees List

A way to list all TwitchCon attendees in a PDF using Typst.

Twitch's Who's Coming page only shows random streamers who are coming to TwitchCon on each page load. I wanted a way to see the full list.

Requires Python 3.12 with some dependencies and the Inter font.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```

2. Run project
    ```sh
    uv run main.py
    ```
